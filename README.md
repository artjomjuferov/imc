# README

Please keep in mind a few things:
- I have started to import hubs and after 30 minutes I interupted the proccess. 
  It started from the first file.
- Autocomplete work properly if autosuggestions appear and then you need
  to select one of them and then click out of the input box.
- I left `gmaps-auto-complete` because I wanted to use it for autocomplete,
  but it allowed me to make only one request per day. So I left it only because
  it makes autocomplete list readable for free.
- If link `https://icm-derevjaginti.c9users.io` does not work please ping me, 
  server could shut down(as it is supposed for development purposes).
